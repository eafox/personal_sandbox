## How I set this up:

To start, I created a new repository on GitHub, cloned it to my local
machine, and then followed the [start-up instructions for
nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html#install-nbdev),
although I used the terminal rather than JupyterLab. This included
installing [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) and
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Once you run `nbdev_new`, the tutorial also takes you through…

- the creation of a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site for
  the new repo and how to [preview the pages
  locally](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html#preview-your-docs),
- setting up [nbdev’s pre-commit
  hooks](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html#install-hooks-for-git-friendly-notebooks)
  to clean notebook metadata (which prevents unnecessary merge
  conflicts), and
- setting up [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to run
  automatically when code is pushed to the master branch.

I also added [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to the pre-commit
hooks to lint and format the code, including notebooks. \* I’ve been
trying to keep the [nbdev
directives](https://nbdev.fast.ai/explanations/directives.html) working
by having Ruff [ignore](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/) code
[E265](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/no-space-after-block-comment/)
which is currently (as of 2024-10-04) [in
preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#what-is-preview) but am still
having trouble. Ruff wants to add a space in between the \# and \|
whereas the directive needs them formatted as \#\|. If I can’t get it to
work, I will have to exempt the nbdev notebooks from Ruff which would be
unfortunate. nbdev is good for being able to annotate code for display
and Ruff replaces several tools in one while being quicker than each of
them as well.

## What comes next:

- Find a large dataset to work with or look into simulation example
  problems.
- Set up logging.
- Set up a project on DigitalOcean (with very extensive spend limits)
  and practice using its various APIs.
- Use [Ibis](https://docs.ibis-project.org/) to interact with a
  database.
- Experiment with
  [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf/api-reference/python/).
- Set up an environment using
  [Docker](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html#example).
- Manage data artifacts with [Dagster](https://docs.dagster.io/).
- Use
  [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)
  to analyze a large dataset.
- Add some tests with
  [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html#add-your-own-examples-tests-and-docs)
  and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/).
- Run something in parallel using a cluster and try running something
  serverless.
- Run some static security analysis tools like
  [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/?s_campaign=SQ-US-States-Brand&s_content=SonarQube&s_term=sonarqube&s_category=Paid&s_source=Paid%20Search&s_origin=Google&cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=21283910625&cq_con=165359618347&cq_term=sonarqube&cq_med=&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_pos=&cq_plt=gp&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw1920BhA3EiwAJT3lSaglN4ruXT0CL6NiF8bG-wKb1-fz9UwT2KUtsNheiNaK-U5jz4ZR8xoC2XIQAvD_BwE),
  [Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/), or
  [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- Regularly check dependencies with
  [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core) or
  [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit).
- Use a service like [DataBricks](https://databricks.com/).
- Work on GCP’s [MLOps
  certification](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/17) (they
  provide test environments, so you don’t need to worry about
  over-spending)
- [Contribute to an open-source
  project](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/17ue6hr/looking_for_beginnerfriendly_python_libraries_to/).
